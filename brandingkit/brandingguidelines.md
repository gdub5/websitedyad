## Messaging Framework

### Value Proposition
"The 80% is automated. The 20% is where you win."

### What We Do
We design dyadic systems where human intelligence and AI work as one unified force to transform customer support.

### How We're Different
Most AI just deflects 70% of tickets and gives up on the rest. We design dyadic systems where AI does the cognitive heavy lifting on complex issues, humans add judgment in minutes not hours, and the system gets smarter every day.

### Key Messages
- Everyone can automate the 80%. Nobody's solved the 20%.
- Not human vs. AI. Not even human + AI. Human and AI as a unified force.
- Complex tickets: 20 minutes → 3 minutes (85% time reduction)
- Your agents handle higher-value work. Customers get personalized solutions.

## The Dyadic Method

### Step 1: Understand Your 80/20
We analyze your ticket data to identify what can be automated (the 80%) and where human judgment creates value (the 20%).

### Step 2: Design Unified Systems
We create workflows where AI and humans work as one unified intelligence—not separate tools coordinating, but a single powerful system.

### Step 3: Implement & Learn
We deploy dyadic systems that get smarter with every interaction. AI learns from human decisions. Humans are empowered by AI preparation.

### Step 4: Optimize & Expand
As confidence grows, more complex issues move to autonomous handling. Your team continuously evolves to higher-value work.

## Elevator Pitch

### 30-Second Version
"Every AI vendor automates 70% of support tickets. That's table stakes.

The question is: what happens with the other 30%—the complex issues, angry customers, edge cases where your brand reputation lives?

We design dyadic systems where AI does 80% of the cognitive work on those complex tickets, humans add judgment in minutes, and both get smarter together.

Result? Your team handles complex issues 85% faster, agents love their work, and customers get the personalized service that builds loyalty."

## Website Copy

### Hero Section
**Headline:** "The 80% is automated. The 20% is where you win."

**Subheadline:** We design dyadic systems where human intelligence and AI work as one unified force to transform your customer support.

### Problem Section
**Title:** "Everyone Can Automate the 80%. Nobody's Solved the 20%."

AI handles routine tickets well—password resets, order tracking, basic FAQs. That's table stakes now.

But the remaining 20-40% of tickets are where companies fail:
- Complex issues requiring judgment
- Angry customers needing empathy
- Edge cases outside normal policies
- High-value customers expecting personalized service

**The current approach:** These escalate to humans who start from scratch, spend 20 minutes researching, and feel overwhelmed.

**The result:** The 20% consumes 80% of your team's time and energy.

### Solution Section
**Title:** "The Dyadic Difference"

We don't just automate the easy 80%. We transform how the critical 20% gets handled.

#### For the 80% (Baseline)
AI handles routine issues autonomously with continuous learning and 24/7 availability. This is table stakes.

#### For the 20% (Our Differentiator)
This is where Dyad CX creates value:

**1. AI does the cognitive heavy lifting**
- Analyzes customer history, sentiment, and value
- Researches similar past resolutions
- Identifies relevant policies and exceptions
- Prepares recommended solution with reasoning

**2. Human applies judgment in seconds**
- Reviews AI's analysis (30 seconds vs. 20 minutes)
- Adds empathy and personalization
- Makes final judgment call
- Sends response

**3. System learns from every decision**
- AI understands why human chose differently
- Confidence improves for similar future cases
- More issues gradually move to autonomous handling

**Result:** Complex tickets that took 20 minutes now take 3 minutes. Agents handle higher-value work. Customers get fast, personalized, empathetic solutions.

## FAQ

### How is this different from a chatbot?
Chatbots handle simple FAQs. Dyadic systems transform how complex issues get resolved—where AI does research and preparation, humans add judgment, and both learn together. It's not about deflection; it's about making your team superhuman on the issues that matter.

### Will this replace our support team?
No. This makes your team more effective. They handle the same volume in less time, or much more volume with the same team size. The goal is empowerment, not replacement.

### How long until we see results?
Pilot projects show measurable improvements in 6-8 weeks. Full transformations deliver complete results in 3-4 months.

### What if our issues are too complex for AI?
That's exactly what dyadic systems solve. When issues are too complex for AI alone, the AI does 80% of the cognitive work and brings humans in for the judgment call. That's the difference.

### Do we need to change our support platform?
No. We work with your existing tools—Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, or whatever you use.

### What's the ROI?
Typical ROI is 3-5x in year one through avoided hiring costs, increased capacity, and improved efficiency. We calculate specific ROI during the assessment based on your ticket volume and team size.
